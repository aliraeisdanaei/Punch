# Punch

This program is designed to create an easy way to record and track the hours one stays productive. You can punch in and punch out, and the program will then echo the current time to a spreadsheet under Productivity. 

One can only punch in and out as many times as they would like. 
The script works with a text based menu as well as with arguments.
